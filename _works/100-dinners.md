### Overview
In 2017, the UBC Alumni Association (aka *alumni UBC*) launched *alumni UBC 100*, a year-long constituent engagement campaign to mark its 100th anniversary. One of the campaign’s major initiatives was 100 Dinners, a newly-created program to help facilitate dinner parties hosted by UBC alumni around the world.

With a limited budget and minimal staff resources for operation, however, the project team was challenged with creating a lean service model, including a central microsite that would require little ongoing maintenance.

Our solution was informed through a combination of discussions with potential participants and extensive dialogue with staff at another organization that ran a similar program. By reducing the service to only its essential parts and leveraged automation wherever possible, we established a model that met core business and user needs with little operational overhead.

### My Role
Working with a team of two *alumni UBC* events staff, I helped to evaluate and synthesize research and devise an blueprint for efficient service delivery. I then designed a lightweight microsite for the program within the *alumni UBC* web infrastructure and assisted IT Services in its development and launch.

##### Main areas of responsibility:
* Research synthesis
* Service design
* Web design

### Audience definition
Like all activities in the *alumni UBC 100* campaign, the 100 Dinners project was intended to help provide UBC alumni with opportunities to stay connected with their alma mater and engage with other graduates.

To that end, the target audience was broadly defined as inclusive of all alumni. There is, however, a self-selecting bias in our audience to those alumni who have elected to keep their contact information up-to-date or are otherwise reachable through institutional communications channels.


### Constituent research
In the early planning phases for *alumni UBC 100*, a series of focus groups were carried out with a variety of alumni. Among other goals, the discussions were intended to gauge interest in possible activities to be pursued in the campaign. With few exceptions, the idea of organizationally-supported, alumni-hosted dinner events was of interest to the majority of participants.

Some months later, a series of emails were sent to constituents explaining the 100 Dinners program and inviting alumni to submit a provisional request to host. From this outreach, we received 128 expressions of interest—enough to feel confident proceeding with development of the program.

### Interviews with 100 Dinners program lead at Johns Hopkins University
The 100 Dinners concept was originally developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for their own centenary. In our discovery phase, the *alumni UBC* 100 Dinners program lead established an ongoing dialogue with her counterpart at Hopkins to learn what did and didn’t work in their implementation.

##### What worked well:
* Providing a searchable online map of dinner locations was highly effective in building interest
* Program staff assisted in email outreach to potential guests in the areas surrounding each dinner
* Asking hosts to take pictures at their events and share with the school

##### What didn’t work well:
* The website grew too complex for internal implementation, necessitating the contracting of external developers and adding costs to the program
* Processing guest RSVPs was handled by program staff and required significant resources
* While hosts were asked to provide guest lists after each dinner, few followed through
* Both guests and hosts relied heavily on asking questions of program staff, rather than referring to online FAQs

### Business goals and measuring success
As a new, untested idea for *alumni UBC*, relatively few concrete business goals were set for the inaugural series of 100 Dinners. The single measurable target we established was a goal of **1,000 total attendees across all events.**

Rather than reinvent the wheel, we chose to build on Hopkins’ program model and address areas where they encountered difficulties.

Our approach included:
* Developing an online system for automated intake of host applications and easy posting of approved events
* Investing a small amount into an external event management platform to handle RSVPs
* Building an online toolkit for hosts, including FAQs, checklists, and suggested pre-event timelines
* Incentivizing post-event reporting and photo submission—in our case, with a prize of two travel vouchers from a program sponsor—and providing an online form to ease the process

### Service blueprint
We developed a detailed service blueprint over several iterations, giving a clear overview of staff and operational requirements:

### Key functions

The 100 Dinners microsite was intended to serve several key functions:
* Facilitating host applications and post-event reporting
* Surfacing details on forthcoming dinners
* Providing information on the program, both general and host-specific
* Showcasing photos from past events

* Event management platform did not have an accessible API, meaning that staff time was spent carrying over details from host application form
