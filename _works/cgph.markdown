### Overview

Cecil Green Park House—a well-known Vancouver event venue—was facing a multi-year decline in revenues. With an outdated website and a poorly-defined brand identity, however, the venue was experiencing high page abandonment rates, and stakeholders were reluctant to invest in new marketing initiatives to drive traffic to the existing site.

While the project initially began as a visual refresh of the original website, it quickly became clear that a broader scope was needed to fully address the underlying business challenges. Working with multiple stakeholders, I first helped to clarify the venue's business goals, brand identity, target audiences, and local competition.

Then, using a human-centered design approach and validating assumptions wherever possible, I undertook design of a new website, a fully-reimagined online booking process, and guidelines for both the brand look and feel and its overall tone of voice.


### My role

I worked on this project as **business analyst, lead designer,** and **product manager.**

##### Main areas of responsibility:

* research and identify business and technical requirements
* define brand identity
* establish guidelines for the brand’s visual appearance and tone of voice
* construct the website’s information architecture
* wireframe, prototype, and design the website’s front-end
* test and evaluate generated ideas
* write copy for the website
* build an analytic framework using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manage;
* take the site through testing and launch.

### Challenge: no resources for research or testing

I was brought into the project several years after stakeholders identified the need for an updated website. This meant that getting a new site online ASAP was their top priority, favouring launch of a minimum viable product with post-hoc testing over preliminary user research.

Nonetheless, I incorporated as much research and testing into my process as was possible, operating on the principle that some data is better than none.

### Business goals

The discovery process began with a series of interviews and workshops with staff and stakeholders to **clarify the business's long-term goals:**

* Reach capacity of 100 weddings per season
* Grow the number of corporate retreats and other business events
* Increase number of holiday parties
* Increase number of UBC bookings
* Keep number of bookings for TV/movie filming at current pace

### SWOT analysis

Next, I undertook a top-level analysis of the business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats:

### Competitive research

Complementing the SWOT analysis was research on the most salient information on the venue’s local competition:

### Provisional personas

Lacking budget for conducting research with past or prospective clients, I relied on a variety of alternate approaches.

Interviews with venue staff&mdash;the business’s primary client liaisons&mdash;were critical to providing initial demographic data on the primary audiences.

This flowed naturally into a workshop with staff and stakeholders where we defined several provisional user personas:

For our main personas, we also developed provisional journey maps:

### Review of Google Analytics demographics

The final step in my audience discovery process was to review Google Analytics data from the original website.

##### The average visitor to the original site was:

* Female, age 25-34
* Located in the greater Vancouver area
* Most interested in the photo gallery and wedding information pages
* A first-time site visitor

This data supported the information provided by venue staff and **gave added weight to use of provisional personas in guiding design decisions.**

### Heuristic analysis of original site

I completed my discovery phase with a heuristic analysis of the original website, using a 247-point checklist found [here](https://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/guidelines.html).

![Heuristic analysis of original site](/uploads/Heuristic-Analysis-Min.png)

While I knew this project would require a fully-redesigned website, heuristic analysis allowed me to become familiar with the original site and gauge what aspects should be carried forward in the new design.

### A “just enough” approach

With a condensed working window, we adopted a “just enough” approach to branding. Through a series of facilitated workshops and discussions, I helped venue staff and stakeholders distill core aspects of the brand, while still leaving room for further refinement in the future.

### Look and feel

After several iterations, we arrived on a look and feel that emphasized whitespace, a colour palette inspired by coastal gardens, and big, bold imagery that highlights both the natural beauty of the space and the people that give it life.

![Style Tile](/uploads/CGPH-Style-Tile-1920-min.png)

### Tone of voice

The brand voice is warm and welcoming, guided by the idea that “the house is old, the audience isn’t.” Working in tandem with the imagery, we evoke the unique sensory experiences found across the house grounds.

### Defining website goals

We identified several key areas of focus for the new website, along with metrics to track their success:

### Challenge #1 - Simplify information architecture and navigation

##### Problem: complex original site architecture
Despite the relatively small scale of the original site, a review of its information architecture revealed a surprising complex structure:

![Original site information architecture](/uploads/CGPH-old-IA.png)

##### Solution: simplify, focusing on core user needs
After presenting the original site map to stakeholders and ascertaining that none had an interest in adding new content, all agreed that a simpler structure was needed.

I then reviewed usage statistics in Google Analytics to determine the most popular pages of the original site and identify common user flows, giving insight on how to best organize the new information architecture.  

Several principles guided my revised structure:
* Give greater hierarchal prominence to high-performing sections of the original site.
* Wherever possible, ensure that each page has the potential to support one or more business goals.
* Ensure that essential information is in its most contextually relevant location, rather than grouped under a catch-all FAQ.
* Label navigational elements and page titles according to the primary tasks, interests, and/or needs of the key audiences (e.g. “request booking”, “weddings”, “meetings and events”, etc.).
* Remove pages only intended for confirmed clients (e.g. information on usage policies for the venue) from the global architecture and block these pages from search engines.
* Create tailored, individual pages in cases where similar content is being served to multiple target audiences (e.g. information on preferred vendors for both weddings and business event), rather than sending all audiences to a single page with information irrelevant to their needs.
* If the venue does not have the resources to ensure that they can regularly create and publish blog content, then remove this aspect of the site.
* If possible, reduce the navigational hierarchy to no more than two levels (e.g. no third-tier navigational elements).

### Opportunity for improvement
While the revised site structure is relatively shallow, there is still potential for its improvement through card sorting exercises with users.

### Challenge #2 - Improve the online booking request system

##### Problem: Frustrating, multi-step process for checking availability
Given the strong emphasis by all stakeholders on the goal of increasing venue bookings, the online booking request system is, perhaps, the website’s most important functional element.

The original system, however, forced users through a multi-step process to check venue availability:

![Old booking process flow](/uploads/CGPH-Old-Booking-Process.png){:height="222px" width="600px"}

Beside the fact that users on mobile devices were particularly averse to this (as verified in the data for site drop-offs), the booking calendar file was only periodically updated&mdash;meaning that visitors often made requests for dates that had already been booked.

##### Solution: Design a system for surfacing real-time booking data

I consulted with venue staff to investigate the parameters of their backend booking system and ideate possible approaches. Eventually, we settled on the idea of a calendar interface that surfaced real-time booking information. This was further distilled to a few core requirements:

* Each date has three possible booking periods (morning, evening, and full-day)
* Calendar must visually differentiate between dates with partial and full-day bookings

##### First iteration
I worked with IT services to determine which data could be extracted from the venue's backend booking system. This lead to my first design for the date picker UI, using orange circles to indicate dates with partial-day bookings and red to indicate full-day bookings:

![Cecil Green Park House booking calendar date picker v1](/uploads/cgph_booking_calendar-v1-cropped.png)

In this case, users interested in dates with half-day bookings would first need to choose a date before seeing their options in the associated time picker:

![Cecil Green Park House booking calendar time picker](/uploads/cgph_timepicker_buttons-cropped.PNG)

##### Second iteration

When presenting my proposed design to venue staff, it emerged that an important specification was missed from the first iteration: the inclusion of tentative bookings (or “holds”).

To accommodate this, I revised my design to indicate dates with holds using crosshatching:

![Cecil Green Park House booking calendar date picker v1](/uploads/cgph_booking_calendar-v2-cropped.png)

##### Usability testing

I took a prototype of this design to several individuals for “guerilla” user testing, asking them to perform several tasks and answer questions on the system’s functionality.

Among the results, I found that:
* Forcing users to first select a date before learning the availability of their preferred time slot added cognitive load to the process, particularly for mobile users.
* Differentiating crosshatching from solid colours was difficult for some users with vision impairments.

##### Third iteration and validation
With this information, I revised my design to include complete details on each day’s booking availability using only solid, contrasting colours:
* Show calendar v3 (final)

After conducting another round of guerilla testing, **no users reported any of the previously-encountered problems, and all were able to complete the instructed tasks.**

##### Form interaction tracking with Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics

To ensure the ongoing optimization of the booking form and gain insights into its usage, I implemented a custom adaptation of Simo Ahava’s [form interaction tracking system](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-form-engagement-with-google-tag-manager/). With this, site administrators are able to see how users are traversing the form, where they abandon, and how they reach the final goal of submission:

![Form interaction tracking results](/uploads/CGPH-Booking-form-abandonments-min.png)

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="callout left-highlight bottom-margin">
### Opportunities for improvement

* Increased visibility on site - post-launch testing has shown the information on house availability is hard-to-find unless already exploring the booking request page
* Some users report confusion on the definition of booking holds - need to provide contextual clarification
* Several users submit bookings, but ask for details on wedding pricing (found elsewhere on the site) - need to find a way to serve them this info before they need to ask
</div>

### Challenge #3 - Improve the site-wide mobile experience
### Challenge #4 - Strengthen appeal to business clientele
### Challenge #5 - Improve the photo gallery system

{% include markup-styles/callout--fullWidth.html headline="Results" %}
Since launching in August 2018, the the new website has resulted in several significant improvements over the same period in the previous year:
* 70% increase in online booking requests.
* 20% increase in booking requests for business or other non-wedding events.
* 114% increase in unique page views on the booking request page.
* 64% increase in unique page views from mobile and tablet devices
* 18% decrease in the site-wide bounce rate (21% for mobile and tablet)
* 48% increase in unique page views on the photo gallery directory

Anecdotally, several clients have specifically praised the new booking system, claiming that it made their process easy and enjoyable to complete.
